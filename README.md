# MiniTools
This project was created in React, using a Typescript Template!

MiniTools is a collection of useful tools that can help you with your daily tasks. The tools included in this app are:

- **TodoList**: Keep track of your tasks and never forget anything again!
- **Weather**: Check the weather forecast for your location or any other place in the world.
- **Calculator**: Perform basic arithmetic operations quickly and easily.
- **Cronometers**: Measure time intervals with precision.
- **Value converter**: Convert between different currencies and get up-to-date exchange rates.
- **Units converter**: Convert between metric and imperial units.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### 'npm start'
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### 'npm run build'
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

## Credits
This app was created by Kevin Lagona. You can find his GitHub page [here](https://github.com/Heroes342). MiniTools was made in one week for an exam, using all the basics of React such as useState, useEffect, routes, useContext, custom hooks, hooks and API calls.
